## Prerequisites

- [ ] Completed Lab 1: Inline Completion
- [ ] Working task management system from Lab 1
- [ ] GitHub Copilot Chat enabled in your IDE

## Step 1: Introduction to Chat Mode

### 1.1 Opening Copilot Chat

**In Visual Studio Code:**
- Press **Ctrl+Shift+I** or click the Chat icon
- Or use **View > Open Chat**

**In Visual Studio 2022:**
- Press **Alt+/** or use **View > GitHub Copilot Chat**

### 1.2 First Chat Interaction

**💬 Chat Exercise 1**: Start with this question:

```
I have a task management system with basic CRUD operations. What are 3 important features I should add to make it more useful for real-world scenarios?
```

**Observe**: How Chat provides structured, thoughtful recommendations vs simple code completion.

## Step 2: Architectural Guidance with Chat

### 2.1 Data Persistence Strategy

**💬 Chat Exercise 2**: Ask about data storage:

```
My task system currently uses in-memory storage. What are the pros and cons of different data storage options for a small task management app? Consider JSON files, SQLite, and SQL Server.
```

**Follow-up**: Ask for implementation details of your preferred option.

### 2.2 Service Layer Design

**💬 Chat Exercise 3**: Get architectural advice:

```
Should I add a service layer between my TaskItemController and data storage? What are the benefits and how should I structure it?
```

## Step 3: Implement JSON Storage with Chat Guidance

### 3.1 Design Data Service

**💬 Chat Exercise 4**: Ask for service design:

```
Create a TaskItemService class that saves task items to a JSON file. Include methods for CRUD operations and make it thread-safe for multiple users. Show me the complete implementation.
```

### 3.2 Create the Service

1. **Create** `Services` folder
2. **Create** `Services/TaskItemService.cs`
3. **Implement** the Chat-suggested service
4. **Ask follow-up questions** if anything is unclear

### 3.3 Register Service

**💬 Chat Exercise 5**: Ask about dependency injection:

```
How do I register my TaskItemService in Program.cs and inject it into my TaskItemController? Show me the updated code.
```

## Step 4: Add Advanced Features with Chat

### 4.1 Task Categories

**💬 Chat Exercise 6**: Design category system:

```
I want to add categories to my task items (like Work, Personal, Shopping). How should I modify my TaskItem model and what UI changes do I need? Show me the complete implementation.
```

### 4.2 Due Date Reminders

**💬 Chat Exercise 7**: Ask about reminder logic:

```
How can I add a feature to show overdue tasks and tasks due soon? I want to highlight them differently in the UI. Provide the logic and view updates.
```

### 4.3 Task Priorities

**💬 Chat Exercise 8**: Design priority system:

```
Add a priority system (Low, Medium, High, Urgent) to tasks. Show me how to update the model, controller, and views. Include proper styling for different priorities.
```

## Step 5: Error Handling and Validation with Chat

### 5.1 Robust Error Handling

**💬 Chat Exercise 9**: Ask about error handling:

```
What error handling should I add to my task management system? Consider file operations, validation, and user input. Show me best practices with code examples.
```

### 5.2 Advanced Validation

**💬 Chat Exercise 10**: Improve validation:

```
My task creation form needs better validation. Add custom validation for:
- Due date cannot be in the past
- Task title must be unique
- Description has character limits
Show me both model and client-side validation.
```

## Step 6: UI/UX Improvements with Chat

### 6.1 Better User Experience

**💬 Chat Exercise 11**: Ask about UX improvements:

```
What UI/UX improvements would make my task management system more user-friendly? Consider sorting, filtering, search, and visual design. Provide specific recommendations.
```

### 6.2 Responsive Design

**💬 Chat Exercise 12**: Improve mobile experience:

```
How can I make my task list more mobile-friendly? Show me Bootstrap classes and responsive design improvements for the task table and forms.
```

## Step 7: Testing Strategy with Chat

### 7.1 Unit Testing Approach

**💬 Chat Exercise 13**: Ask about testing:

```
What unit tests should I write for my TaskItemService and TaskItemController? Show me example test methods using xUnit and explain what each test validates.
```

### 7.2 Integration Testing

**💬 Chat Exercise 14**: Learn about integration tests:

```
How do I test the complete flow from controller to JSON file storage? Show me an integration test example that creates, reads, updates, and deletes a task item.
```

## Step 8: Performance and Security with Chat

### 8.1 Performance Optimization

**💬 Chat Exercise 15**: Ask about performance:

```
My task item list could grow to thousands of items. What performance optimizations should I implement for loading, searching, and paging? Show me the implementation.
```

### 8.2 Security Considerations

**💬 Chat Exercise 16**: Learn about security:

```
What security considerations should I implement for a task management system? Consider input validation, file access, and potential vulnerabilities.
```

## Step 9: Chat vs Inline Comparison

### 9.1 When to Use Each Mode

**💬 Chat Exercise 17**: Ask for guidance:

```
When should I use Chat mode vs inline completion for development tasks? Give me specific scenarios and examples of each.
```

### 9.2 Effective Chat Prompting

**💬 Chat Exercise 18**: Learn prompting techniques:

```
What makes a good prompt for GitHub Copilot Chat? Give me examples of effective vs ineffective prompts with explanations.
```
